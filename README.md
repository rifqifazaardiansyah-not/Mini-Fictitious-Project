# Mini-Fictitious-Project
This is my first small project as a first step to explore the field of data analyst and data science. There is a small dataset that contains fictitious umkm sales. Then from the data set, I visualize it in the form of a diagram which I then make a dashboard using streamlit, so that insight can be seen from the data set.
